<br><font face="Vogue" color="white" size="6">What Are Savings?</font><br><br>
<font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Savings refers to the money that a person has left over after they subtract out their consumer spending from their disposable income over a given time period. Savings, therefore, represents a net surplus of funds for an individual or household after all expenses and obligations have been paid.<br><br>

Savings are kept in the form of cash or cash equivalents (e.g. as bank deposits), which are exposed to no risk of loss but also come with correspondingly minimal returns. Savings can be grown through investing, which requires that the money be put at risk, however.</font><br><br><br><hr><br>
<font face="Vogue" color="white" size="6">Understanding Savings</font>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10">
<tr><td><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3"><ul><li>Savings comprise the amount of money left over after spending. People may save for various life goals or aspirations such as retirement, a child's college education, the down payment for a home or car, a vacation, or several other examples</li></ul></font></td>
<td><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3"><ul><li>Savings may commonly be earmarked for emergencies. For example, Sashaâ€™s monthly paycheck is $5,000. Expenses include a $1,300 rent payment, a $450 car payment, a $500 student loan payment, a $300 credit card payment, $250 for groceries, $75 for utilities, $75 for cellphone service, and $100 for gas. Since Sasha's monthly income is $5,000 and monthly expenses are $3,050, there is $1,950 leftover as savings. If Sasha maintains this excess as savings and later faces an emergency, there will be some money to live on while resolving the issue.</li></ul></font></td>  
<tr><td colspan="2"><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3"><ul><li>If one is unable to maintain savings, they may be said to be living paycheck to paycheck. If such a person experiences an emergency, there is often not enough money saved up to live on and they may risk falling into debt or bankruptcy.</li></ul></font><hr>

<font face="Vogue" color="white" size="6">How To Calculate Your Savings Rate?</font>
<br><br>
<font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">One's savings rate is the percentage of disposable personal income that is kept rather than spent on consumption or obligations.7Say that your net income is $25,000 a year after taxes (i.e., your disposable income) and over the course of the year you also spend $24,000 in consumption, bills, and other expenditures. Your total savings are $1,000. Dividing savings by disposable income yields a savings rate of 4% = ($1,000 / $25,000 x 100).</font><br><br><br>

<font face="Vogue" color="white" size="6">Savings VS. Investing</font><br><br>
<table border="0" cellpadding="20"><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">
<tr><th><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Purpose and Time Horizon</font></th>
<th><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Risk and Return</font></th></tr>
<tr><td><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Saving: The primary purpose of saving is to set aside money for short-term goals or emergencies. The time horizon for saving is usually within a few months to a few years.<br><br>
    Investing: Investing is focused on achieving long-term financial goals. It involves putting money into assets with the expectation of generating a return or profit over an extended period, often spanning years or decades.</font></td>
<td><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Saving: Saving is considered a low-risk approach. Money is typically placed in safe and easily accessible accounts like savings accounts or money market funds. While it preserves capital and offers stability, the returns are generally modest and may not keep up with inflation.<br><br>
Investing: Investing carries a higher level of risk. Various investment options, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or mutual funds, offer different risk profiles. While investments can provide higher returns over the long term, they are subject to market fluctuations and could result in losses.</font></td></tr>
<tr><th><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Accessibility</font></th>
<th><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Purpose of Returns</font></th></tr>
<tr><td><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Saving: Savings are highly liquid and easily accessible. You can withdraw money from a savings account or cash-equivalent quickly and without significant penalties.<br><br>
Investing: Investments may have restrictions on accessibility. Some investments, like certain retirement accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs), may require a specific holding period or involve penalties for early withdrawal.</font></td>
<td><font face="Helvetica" color="white" size="3">Saving: The primary purpose of saving is to preserve the value of money and have funds available for immediate needs or short-term goals. While it provides financial security, saving may not offer substantial growth in wealth.<br><br>
Investing: Investing aims to grow wealth over time. The goal is to achieve returns that outpace inflation and provide a higher potential for significant growth. Investing is instrumental in building wealth for long-term financial objectives like retirement or achieving financial independence.</font></td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>In summary, saving is a low-risk, short-term approach focused on liquidity and stability, while investing involves taking on higher risk for potentially higher returns over a more extended period to achieve long-term financial goals. A well-balanced financial strategy typically incorporates both saving and investing to ensure financial security in the short term and substantial growth in wealth over the long term.<br><br>
